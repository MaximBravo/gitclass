Lesson 1

git a version control system
github sharing and colaboration platform
unix style comand line
lesson 1: how version control could be useful and what diffrent forms it might take also install git.
lesson 2: more about git and start using it
lesson 3: get some practice sharing and colaborating code with others using github.

diffrence between files
windows - fc (file compare)
mac of linux - diff (difference)

I am using linux so this is what you type:
cd Downloads/
first get to Downloads then
diff -u favorite-app-old.html favorite-app.html

tools make comparing more easy

version control in dropbox, docs, and wikipedia

when would you want to have a version of your code saved?
answer: whenever a large enough change is made such as 50 lines
In git when you have a change then you have a commit

type-of children are: manual saving, dropbox, google docs, wikipedia, git, svn
child of git is commit
diff is a child of commit
there is a picture of the map down below.


to see changes in git use:
git diff firstId secondId

commits shouldnt be to big or to small make a comit per Logical Change Solution
makes sense to track files together: html and css files that make up  a webpage
and photos you have photoshopped
not: A novel, split up by chapter or competitiion-style coding

git calls a collection of files is called a repository
if you have three files and you only change one then git will track all three files when one file is changed
a comit is a time '
so you could change something and 6:54 and that comit shows all three files states at 6:54

if you have a multi file commit then it will show the changes in all of the files
to download git:
sudo apt-get install git
to check version:
git --version

to clone a repository:
git clone linkToTheRepository
linkToTheRepository = a link to a repository.
d 
To get colored diff output, run:
git config --global color.ui auto
